# InfoPath Forms Services Assessment

The Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool helps you identify and evaluate the InfoPath Forms Services usage on your tenant by providing you the [usage data of InfoPath Forms Services](assess.md), and generating a [Power BI report](report-intro.md) to help plan migrating InfoPath Forms Services usage to Power Apps, Power Automate, Forms or other supported solutions.
